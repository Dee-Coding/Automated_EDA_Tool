# Automated EDA Tool

This is a Python script that performs Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset. It generates visualization dashboards for selected columns based on their data types.

## Features

- Load data from CSV, Excel, or SQL databases.
- Visualize categorical columns using Seaborn's count plots.
- Visualize numerical columns using Plotly's histograms.
- Handle missing or inappropriate data types.
- User input for selecting columns to visualize.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory.

3. Run the script using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python automated_eda.py

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory.

3. Run the script using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python automated_eda.py
4. Choose the data source (csv, excel, sql) when prompted.

5. Follow the instructions to provide the necessary information (e.g., file path, SQL query) based on your data source choice.

6. Enter the column names (comma-separated) you want to visualize.

7. The script will generate visualization dashboards for the selected columns using Seaborn and Plotly.

8. The generated visualization dashboards will be displayed in the terminal.

## Example Usage
- Choose data source: csv
- Enter CSV file path: data.csv
- Enter column names for visualization: Age, Gender
- Visualization dashboards will be generated and displayed.
## Note
- For SQL data source, you need to provide the connection details (server name and database name) in the script.
- Please make sure to replace placeholders like `data.csv`, `Age`, `Gender`, and update any other information specific to your project.
